# Linkedin video scraper

That's a wip for downloading videos from https://www.linkedin.com/learning courses. Use at your own risk (:

Clone the repo

`git clone https://github.com/Bwca/linkedin-learning-downloader.git`

And run the built version:

`node dist`

Or install dependencies

`cd linkedin-learning-downloader`

`npm i`

And run it from source:

`npm run start`
