# Linkedin video scraper

That's a wip for downloading videos from https://www.linkedin.com/learning courses. Use at your own risk (:

Download [compiled version](https://github.com/Bwca/linkedin-learning-downloader/blob/master/dist/linkedin-learning-downloader.js) and run it:

`node ./linkedin-learning-downloader.js`

Or run it from source by cloning the repo:

`git clone https://github.com/Bwca/linkedin-learning-downloader.git`
`cd linkedin-learning-downloader`

Install dependencies:

`npm i`

Run it from source:

`npm run start`

Build it from source:

`npm run build`

As of yet, requires entering csrf-token and cookie from current session for authorisation.
